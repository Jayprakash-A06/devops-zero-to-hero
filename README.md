my devops journey with github
- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Jayprakash. I'm currently learning DevOps from scratch, starting with foundational skills like shell scripting and GitHub for automation and version control. Now, I'm focusing on AWS services to gain expertise in cloud computing. My goal is to build a strong DevOps skill set, including CI/CD, infrastructure as code, and cloud deployment.

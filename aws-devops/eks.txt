🔹 Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) – Key Components & Features
🔹 What is Amazon EKS?

Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) is a fully managed Kubernetes service that allows you to run Kubernetes clusters on AWS without managing the control plane. It provides scalability, security, and high availability for containerized applications.

EKS simplifies Kubernetes operations by automating control plane management, security, and scaling while integrating with AWS services like IAM, VPC, and CloudWatch.
1️⃣ Key Components of Amazon EKS

EKS is built on Kubernetes architecture, and its core components include:
🔹 1. Control Plane (Managed by AWS)

    AWS automatically manages and scales the control plane across multiple Availability Zones.

    Handles API requests, scheduling, and cluster state management.

    Consists of etcd (data store), Kubernetes API server, scheduler, and controller manager.

🔹 2. Worker Nodes (Managed by You)

    EC2 instances or AWS Fargate run the actual containers.

    Nodes are grouped into node groups, which are auto-scaled based on demand.

🔹 3. EKS Add-ons

    Pre-configured Kubernetes components (CoreDNS, VPC CNI, kube-proxy).

    Can install additional add-ons like AWS Load Balancer Controller, Cluster Autoscaler, etc..

🔹 4. Kubernetes API

    The Kubernetes API server manages cluster interactions.

    Developers interact with it via kubectl or AWS SDKs.

🔹 5. AWS VPC (Networking)

    EKS runs inside an Amazon VPC.

    Uses AWS CNI (Container Network Interface) for pod-to-pod communication.

    Supports private and public subnets.

🔹 6. IAM (Identity and Access Management)

    Uses IAM roles for Kubernetes service accounts.

    Granular access control using RBAC (Role-Based Access Control).

🔹 7. AWS Load Balancers (Networking)

    Supports ALB (Application Load Balancer) and NLB (Network Load Balancer) for external traffic.

    Automatically provisions load balancers based on Kubernetes Ingress.

🔹 8. Storage (EBS, EFS, S3)

    Supports Amazon EBS for block storage.

    Amazon EFS for persistent shared storage across multiple pods.

    Can use S3 for object storage.

🔹 9. Logging & Monitoring

    Uses CloudWatch, AWS X-Ray, Prometheus, Grafana for monitoring.

    Can enable AWS Audit Logs for security insights.

2️⃣ Key Features of Amazon EKS
Feature	Description
Managed Kubernetes Control Plane	AWS handles Kubernetes control plane upgrades, availability, and scaling.
Multi-Availability Zone (AZ) Deployment	The control plane is highly available across multiple AZs, ensuring reliability.
Integration with AWS Services	Works with IAM, VPC, CloudWatch, ALB, EBS, S3, etc.
Security & IAM Integration	IAM authentication & RBAC support for granular access control.
Networking with AWS VPC CNI	Ensures fast, native networking between Kubernetes pods and AWS services.
Supports EC2 & Fargate	Can run workloads on EC2 instances or serverless AWS Fargate.
Automatic Scaling	Works with Cluster Autoscaler to add/remove nodes dynamically.
Observability & Logging	Uses CloudWatch, Prometheus, Grafana, FluentBit for logs and metrics.
Supports Kubernetes Ecosystem	Can run Helm charts, Kustomize, Kubectl, and other Kubernetes tools.
Multi-Cluster & Hybrid Deployments	Can deploy across AWS, on-premises, and hybrid environments with EKS Anywhere.
Cost Optimization	Supports Spot Instances, Auto Scaling, and Fargate to reduce costs.
3️⃣ How Amazon EKS Works? (Flow)

1️⃣ Create an EKS Cluster → AWS sets up a Kubernetes control plane.
2️⃣ Launch Worker Nodes (EC2 or Fargate) → Nodes join the cluster.
3️⃣ Deploy Applications using kubectl or Helm charts.
4️⃣ Manage Networking & Storage → Uses AWS Load Balancers, EBS, EFS, S3.
5️⃣ Monitor & Scale → Uses CloudWatch, Auto Scaling, and Cluster Autoscaler.
4️⃣ When to Use Amazon EKS?

✅ Use Amazon EKS if:
✔️ You need Kubernetes for container orchestration.
✔️ You want high availability and scalability for your workloads.
✔️ You need multi-cloud or hybrid cloud support.
✔️ You want deep AWS integration (IAM, CloudWatch, VPC).
✔️ Your team has Kubernetes expertise.

❌ Don't use EKS if:
❌ You don't need Kubernetes (use ECS instead for simpler workloads).
❌ You want a fully serverless experience (Use ECS Fargate).
❌ Your workloads are small and can be run on Docker or AWS Lambda.
5️⃣ ECS vs. EKS: Which One to Choose?
Feature	EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)	ECS (Elastic Container Service)
Orchestration	Kubernetes	AWS-native
Complexity	More complex	Easier
Multi-Cloud	Yes	No (AWS-only)
Scaling	Uses Kubernetes Cluster Autoscaler	ECS Auto Scaling
Node Management	Uses EC2, Fargate	Uses EC2, Fargate
Networking	AWS VPC CNI, Kubernetes Ingress	AWS VPC, ELB
Best For	Kubernetes users, multi-cloud apps	AWS-native, simpler apps

🚀 Use EKS if you need Kubernetes. Use ECS if you want a simpler AWS-native solution.
6️⃣ Summary

    EKS is a fully managed Kubernetes service that runs containerized applications on AWS.

    AWS manages the Kubernetes control plane while you manage worker nodes.

    Deep AWS integration with IAM, VPC, ALB, EBS, S3.

    Supports EC2, Fargate, Auto Scaling, Load Balancers, and Multi-Cluster deployments.

    Ideal for Kubernetes workloads but ECS is better for simpler AWS-native apps.

🔁 1. Recreate Deployment
✅ What it is:

    The old version is stopped, and the new version is started.

    Only one version is live at any time.

🎯 When to Use:

    Suitable for low-traffic or internal applications.

    Acceptable where short downtime is not a major issue.

💡 Why to Use:

    Simple to implement.

    No need for additional infrastructure or routing logic.

🛠️ Real-World Example:

    A small company’s internal HR portal is updated monthly at night.

    DevOps stops the old app and deploys the new one during off-peak hours.

🟩 2. Blue-Green Deployment
✅ What it is:

    Two environments: Blue (live) and Green (new/staging).

    You deploy the new version to Green, test it, and switch traffic from Blue to Green.

🎯 When to Use:

    For critical applications where downtime is not acceptable.

    When you want easy rollback in case of failure.

💡 Why to Use:

    Zero-downtime deployment.

    Instant rollback by switching traffic back to the old environment.

🛠️ Real-World Example:

    An e-commerce website like Flipkart or Amazon uses Blue-Green for checkout services.

    If a bug is found after deploying to Green, they can instantly switch back to Blue.

🟡 3. Canary Deployment
✅ What it is:

    The new version is released to a small percentage of users (like 5%) and monitored.

    If no issues are detected, more users are gradually moved to the new version.

🎯 When to Use:

    When you want to test in production with minimal risk.

    Suitable for large-scale user bases where a bug can be expensive.

💡 Why to Use:

    Helps catch hidden bugs early.

    Allows gradual rollout, reducing risk.

🛠️ Real-World Example:

    Spotify releases a new UI update to 5% of users.

    If analytics and crash reports are good, they scale to 50%, then 100%.

🔄 4. Rolling Deployment
✅ What it is:

    Update one server or container at a time, gradually rolling the change across all instances.

🎯 When to Use:

    When you want to avoid downtime, but don't want to run two environments (like Blue-Green).

    Suitable for Kubernetes clusters or Docker Swarms.

💡 Why to Use:

    Saves infrastructure cost.

    Easy to manage in container orchestration platforms.

🛠️ Real-World Example:

    In a Kubernetes cluster, you set a Deployment to update 1 pod at a time out of 10 total.

    You can monitor CPU, memory, and errors before updating the next pod.

🧪 5. A/B Testing Deployment
✅ What it is:

    Run two different versions (A and B) simultaneously for different user segments.

    Useful for product experiments.

🎯 When to Use:

    When testing which version performs better (e.g., different UI designs).

    In marketing-driven development.

💡 Why to Use:

    Allows data-driven decisions.

    Can increase user engagement or conversions.

🛠️ Real-World Example:

    Netflix shows a new UI to 30% of users (version B).

    If engagement improves over version A, they roll out B to everyone.

👥 6. Shadow Deployment
✅ What it is:

    A copy of live traffic is sent to the new version.

    The new version is not live, just being observed.

🎯 When to Use:

    When you want to test a high-risk feature under real load.

    Ideal for machine learning models, payment systems, etc.

💡 Why to Use:

    No impact on users.

    Helps test performance, scalability, and integration without risk.

🛠️ Real-World Example:

    A bank is upgrading its loan approval engine.

    Before making it live, it receives real user input in shadow mode to compare results with the old engine.

🧰 7. Feature Toggle (Feature Flags)
✅ What it is:

    Code is deployed, but features are turned ON/OFF using a toggle or flag.

    Often combined with other deployment strategies.

🎯 When to Use:

    When you want to deploy code frequently but release features slowly.

    Useful for agile teams.

💡 Why to Use:

    Safe to push code without enabling the feature.

    Enables quick rollback of features without redeploying.

🛠️ Real-World Example:

    Facebook uses feature flags to test changes for internal users (employees) before public rollout.

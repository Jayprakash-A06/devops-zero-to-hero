### **Solution for GitHub Error: `! [rejected] main -> main (non-fast-forward)`**  

This error happens when your local branch is **behind** the remote branch on GitHub.  
It means **someone else (or you from another device) has pushed new commits** to GitHub, and Git won't let you push until you sync your changes.

---

## **Steps to Fix the Error**
### **1. Fetch the Latest Changes from GitHub**
Run:
```sh
git fetch origin
```
This downloads the latest commits **without merging** them.

---

### **2. Pull the Latest Changes into Your Local Branch**
Run:
```sh
git pull origin main --rebase
```
This will:
✅ **Merge remote changes** with your local code.  
✅ **Keep your commits on top** (avoids unnecessary merge commits).  

If you get conflicts, Git will ask you to **resolve them manually** before proceeding.

---

### **3. Push Your Changes Again**
Once you've successfully pulled the latest changes, push your code:
```sh
git push origin main
```
This should now work **without errors**.

---

## **Alternative: Force Push (Only If Necessary)**
If you are **sure** you want to overwrite remote changes (⚠️ **Dangerous!**), you can **force push**:
```sh
git push --force origin main
```
⚠️ **Warning**: This **overwrites** the remote branch and may **delete** other people's changes.

---

## **Summary**
| **Step** | **Command** | **Why?** |
|----------|------------|-----------|
| Fetch updates | `git fetch origin` | Download the latest changes from GitHub |
| Merge changes | `git pull origin main --rebase` | Sync your branch with GitHub |
| Push updates | `git push origin main` | Upload your changes to GitHub |
| Force push (if necessary) | `git push --force origin main` | Overwrites remote changes (⚠️ Risky!) |
